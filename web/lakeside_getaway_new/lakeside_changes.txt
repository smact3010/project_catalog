-Remove:
  The last item on the rooms page is the Rate with the drop down arrow.  The prices listed are confusing if one does not hit the "View Calendar" icon.  We think it would be better NOT to give choice of listed  prices and then option to hit calendar menu.  Just make it go straight to the calendar rates.

The photos tab, starts out and shows several pictures.  I want the Amenities listed first, then the photos 2nd.

I'm sending you a text picture of our boat launch.  I want to add this to the list of other photos. Can you put the words:
Boat Launch imposed on the picture.

The only verbage change for the listed amenities is delete the word Minnows.  We no longer sell them, we still have worms & Ice.
